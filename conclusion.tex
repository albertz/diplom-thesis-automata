\section{Conclusion}

TODO: RÃ¼ckblick

In \cref{concrete-results}, we studied some of the most well-known subclasses of the class of regular $*$-languages. There are many more regular language subclasses like local languages, $L$-trivial or $R$-trivial languages or locally modulo testable languages. On all these classes, we can probably apply some of the results from \cref{general-results}.

Also interesting are supersets of the class of regular $*$-languages. One important class are the context-free languages. Also deterministic context-free languages or context-sensitive languages might be interesting to study in this context. A starting point to study these classes are to extend the results from \cref{general-results} to pushdown automata or other more generic cases.
