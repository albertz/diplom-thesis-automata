\section{Introduction}

Language theory is strongly connected to the theory of automata. With some interpretation of run-acceptance in an automaton, we canonically get a language.

We call languages over infinite words the $*$-languages and often use $\Lang^*$ or some variant for such language class. Likewise, $\omega$-languages ($\Lang^\omega$) are over infinite words. The acceptance-condition in automata for $*$-languages is straight-forward. If we look at $\omega$-languages, several different types of automata and their acceptance have been thought of. For the class of regular languages, we see that many of them are equivalent.

For all types, we can also argue with equivalent language-theoretical operators which operate on a $*$-language. We will study the equivalences in more detail.

Depending on the $* \rightarrow \omega$ language operator (or the $\omega$-automaton acceptance condition), we get different $\omega$-language classes. This was studied earlier already in detail for the class of regular $*$-languages.

When we look at other $*$-language classes, we might get different results. This study is the main topic of this thesis.
